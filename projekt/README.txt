==== MAY THE SOURCE BE WITH YOU ==== 

Everything you need to compile and run the system is included in this
directory. 

However, you might want to get the most up to date version of this
directory. 
           git:
              http://github.com/hampusadamsson/osm/project


==== ERLANG VERSION ====
     
This software was developed and tested using 
     Erlang R16B01.
     Erlang/OTP 17

==== PYTHON VERSION ====
     
This software was developed and tested using 
     
     Python 3
	      	  	    	       
==== MAKE IT HAPPEN ==== 

Using the make utility you can perform the following actions:

./rebar compile ==-> Compiles the Erlang source files if necessary.
./rebar clean ==> Removes all beam files and html files generated by Edoc.
./rebar eunit -v ==> Runs all Eunit tests.

make ==> Compiles the Erlang source files if necessary. 
make archive ==> Creates a gziped tar archive of this directory. 
make clean ==> Removes all beam files and html files generated by Edoc.
make doc ==> Generates Edoc documentation in the doc/html directory.
make start ==> Starts the system.
make test ==> Runs all Eunit tests.

==== GENERATE PYTHON DOCUMENTATION ====

You can generate documentation for the client by using Pydoc.
Open a terminal in the folder with the Python source code and enter
"pydoc -w ./" to generate HTML documentation for all the modules.

If Python 2 is the standard on your system and you installed Python 3 along side
it, you should instead enter "pydoc3 -w ./"

==== TO COMPILE ====  

To compile the project, simply type make/rebar compile and press enter.
1- make
2- ./rebar compile

==== TO RUN AND TEST THE SYSTEM ==== 

1- ./rebar eunit -v ==> Runs all Eunit tests.
2- make test ==> Runs all Eunit tests.

===== CONFIGURE THE CLIENT =====

The client comes with a configFile in which you have a number of options to change.

reconnectMode= [auto / manual] - Set this to auto if you want the client to automaticly try to reconnect to the server if you lose connection
				 Otherwise reconnect manually with the /connect commando 

delay= [Int] - How long the client should wait between each reconnect attempt

reconnectAmount= [X] - How many times the client should try to reconnect

restoreTabs=[auto / manual] - Set this to auto if you want the client to automaticly restore the rooms you were in if a server crash would occure
			      Othwerwise rejoin the rooms manually

ipAdress= [ipAdress] - The last ipAdress you connected to. If reconnectMode is set to auto, this is the ipAdress the server tries to reconnect to

userName= [Name] - The username you want displayed
